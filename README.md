API and SDK for Cats


## Considerations && Todo's

* This is not API Key protected, so there is not way to make sure we only accept secure requests nor to limit the amount of requests per user.
* The should be refactor and be cleaner.
* Is not published to NPM, nor deployed.
* Need to implement Error handling, it is very poor.
* Need to write tests to make the code more robust.
* I could have make better use of TypeScript classes to define better schemas.
* Implement a real database: SQLite, DynamoDB or LevelDB could be good candidates.
